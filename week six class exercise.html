    <h1>IRONY TO FAST FOOD</h1>




  <h5>Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case.

  This exhaustion can cause a lack of energy, and thus, a lack of physical activity. Often leading to obesity.

  Obese people tend to be addicted to food, otherwise known as having a FOOD ADDICTION.

  Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
  <br>
  However, fast food on the other hand, is a type of mass-produced food that is prepared and served very quickly. The food is typically less nutritionally valuable compared to other foods and dishes.</h5>
