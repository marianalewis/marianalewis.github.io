      AN INCOMPLETE MANIFESTO FOR GROWTH
    <br><br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Allow events to <em>change</em> you. You have to be <em>willing to grow.</em> Growth is different from something that happens to you. <em>You produce it.</em> You <em>live</em> it. The prerequisites for growth: the openness to experience events and the <em>willingness to be changed by them.</em></li>

    <li><em>Forget about good. </em>Good is a known quantity. Good is what we all agree on. Growth is not necessarily good. Growth is an <em>exploration</em> of unlit recesses that may or may not yield to our research. As long as you stick to good you’ll <em>never have real growth.</em></li>

    <li>Process is <em>more</em> important than outcome. When the outcome drives the process we will only ever go to where we’ve already been. <em>If process drives outcome we may not know where we’re going, but we will know we want to be there.</em></li>

    <li>Love your experiments <em>(as you would an ugly child)</em>. Joy is the engine of growth. Exploit the liberty in casting your work as... <br>beautiful experiments, <br>iterations, <br>attempts, <br>trials, <br>and errors. <br>Take the long view and allow yourself <em>the fun of failure</em> every day.</li>

    <li><em>Go deep</em>. The deeper you go the more likely you will discover something of <em>value.</em></li>

    <li>Capture accidents. The <em>wrong answer</em> is the <em>right answer</em> in search of a <em>different question.</em> Collect wrong answers as part of the process. Ask different questions.</li>

    <li>Study. A studio is a place of study. Use the necessity of production as an excuse to study. <em>Everyone will benefit.</em></li>

    <li><em>Drift.</em> <br>Allow yourself to wander <em>aimlessly</em>. <br>Explore <em>adjacencies.</em> <br>Lack <em>judgment.</em> <br>Postpone <em>criticism.</em></li>

    <li>Begin anywhere. John Cage tells us that not knowing where to begin is a common form of paralysis. His advice: <em>begin anywhere.</em></li>

    <li><em>Everyone</em> is a <em>leader.</em> Growth happens. Whenever it does, <em>allow it to emerge.</em> Learn to follow when it makes sense. Let <em>anyone</em> lead.</li>

    <li>Harvest ideas. Edit applications. Ideas need a dynamic, fluid, generous environment to <em>sustain life</em>. Applications, on the other hand, benefit from critical rigor. Produce a high ratio of ideas to applications.</li>

    <li><em>Keep moving.</em> The market and its operations have a tendency to reinforce success. <em>Resist it.</em> Allow failure and migration to be part of your practice.</li>

    <li><em>Slow</em> down. Desynchronize from standard time frames and surprising opportunities may present themselves.</li>

    <li>Don’t be cool. <em>Cool is conservative fear dressed in black.</em> Free yourself from limits of this sort.</li>

    <li>Ask stupid questions. Growth is fuelled by <em>desire and innocence.</em> Assess the answer, not the question. Imagine learning throughout your life at the rate of an infant.</li>

    <li><em>Collaborate.</em> The space between people working together is filled with <em><br>conflict, <br>friction, <br>strife, <br>exhilaration, <br>delight, <br>and vast creative potential.</em></li>

    <li>____________________. Intentionally left blank. Allow <em>s p a c e</em> for the ideas you haven’t had yet, and for the ideas of others.</li>

    <li>Stay up late. Strange things happen when you’ve gone too far, been up too long, worked too hard, and you’re <em>separated from the rest of the world.</em></li>

    <li>Work the <em>metaphor.</em> Every object has the capacity to stand for something other than what is apparent. Work on what it stands for.</li>

    <li>Be careful to <em>take risks</em>. Time is genetic. Today is the <em>child of yesterday</em> and the <em>parent of tomorrow</em>. The work you produce today will <em>create your future.</em></li>
